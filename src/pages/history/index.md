Hand of the Cause of God William Sears and his wife Marguerite Reimer Sears initiated the first Desert Rose Bahá’í School with the assistance of a core group of dedicated friends. This became an annual event for the Southern Arizona Bahá’í’s each Thanksgiving weekend and was held in a rented hall in Tucson, Arizona.

### 1999– Guest House is Built

![guest-house](./_guest_house.webp)

There was a need for additional housing at Desert Rose for guests. David Hadden built a guest house at his expense near the Sears’ cottage for he and his family to use in the winter. The house was given to the Institute for use by visiting dignitaries and kept free for the Haddens whenever they were at Desert Rose.

![casas](./_casas.webp)

As with any not-for-profit organization, DRBI requires reliable sources of income to offset operational costs. An inventive response to this need was the design and construction of the Casas de Rosas. The 16 rental apartments built around a restful courtyard allow for the perfect combination of privacy and community living while providing regular revenue to DRBI.

### 2004 - William Sears Pavilion

It was a vision of the Board of Directors to embody the spiritual peace of the desert in a structure where people could go to reflect, pray, meditate, or celebrate. The Pavilion was dedicated on November 27, 2000. The picture above shows David Hadden and Marguerite Sears preparing to place a box containing the names of all the friends of DRBI who donated towards the Pavilion’s construction.

As weekend camps and retreats became more common it became apparent that DRBI needed more accommodations. The Guffey Center enables up to 50 people to stay during sessions. The Center honors two of DRBI’s steadfast volunteers, Ray and Gloria Guffey. Ray’s impact can be seen in every sidewalk and stone while Gloria continues to serve the Institute in any way she can.

Volunteer Virginia Healey, then part of the DRBI Management learned that the FCC was opening a new license for a low power (LP) radio station for Eloy Arizona.

### 2018 - Guest House becomes the Art Gallery

Early residents and resident artists Duffy and Jeanne Sheridan proposed moving DRBI one step closer to the founders’ original vision by turning the Guest House into an Art Gallery. Using their own funds they converted what had been a two-bedroom home into an art space with room for shows, classes, and both painting and working pottery studios.

In four months alone, one hundred and twenty-two students took 24 classes in everything from painting, pastels, tile glazing and beading techniques to Musubi Stones, Pysanky Egg decorating and Silk Scarf dying. These classes were organized by local artist Bonnie Light, who volunteered her services to DRBI.
