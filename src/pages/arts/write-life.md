## Write Life    by Anne Perry

Write Life began when Marlene Macke and I invited some writers to come to Desert Rose for a week-long writers’ retreat held in February 2018. In preparing and designing the flier for the retreat, one of the local writers connected to Desert Rose called it “Write Life.” The name stuck, and we have continued to hold retreats every February since. The one in 2021 was held on Zoom, and we anticipate another online retreat in 2022.

Marlene was a “snowbird”—a Canadian looking for a winter retreat when she wrote to me in 2014 to get advice on where she could go to write for a couple of months in the winter of 2015. “Desert Rose!” I answered. “Where’s that?” she asked. She acted on the suggestion, acclimating to the creative atmosphere of Desert Rose, making friends there, and generally deciding to return in subsequent winters. In 2017 we planned the first retreat and co-hosted the retreats of 2018 and 2019, and then Marlene’s health began failing. She wasn’t able to come in 2020, and she passed away in January 2021. Write Life owes a huge debt of gratitude to her!

Jaine Toth and I co-hosted the on-ground retreat of 2020, and then Joyce Litoff and I co-hosted the online retreat in 2021. We also started a twice monthly Zoom event—one session as a writers’ “check in” and goal setting time: one session for critique of our work. In addition, we sponsor online workshops through Desert Rose and occasional public readings of our works. All of these activities continue, with Michelle Goering taking on aspects of the leadership as well. A group of local writers have also met at Desert Rose, under the name “Pen and Prayer.”

We invite you to look at our authors’ profiles and see what Write Life writers are up to!  Some have published books and articles recently; some are working on longer projects; some dabble in multiple genres; one is a storyteller who has performed stories publicly—all of us are finding our way through our writing, in the context of a supportive network. Check us out!

teaching trip to Oregon. Visiting communities along route 80 they presented programs about unity in
diversity. The programs, complied by Beverly, included commentary, writings from multiple religions
and Indigenous peoples along with musical selections written by Robert.

settled into their new home in Milwaukie. Beverly continued her education at Marylhurst University,
earning a BA in Human Studies combined with a Montessori Primary Diploma. She taught or

during the Writer’s Life Retreat, Story Commons published her 100-word story.

Our Yellowstone Greeter:

> A mystical, swirling mist greeted us at Yellowstone
one morn. Out of the mist loomed a magnificent bull
moose. Our family and traveling companion were
awestruck and agreed to stop the car.

> The bull sauntered onto the road. Bulls can be
aggressive, charge, knock people down and stomp
on them! We wondered if the car would stimulate
him into aggression. In stillness we recited a special
prayer for removal of difficulties.

> The bull regarded us closely, then with a backward regal look sauntered on. Off we went, to a
yummy saddle cake (gargantuan pancake) breakfast at Cody Inn!

compose talks for presentations at Bahá’í Holy Day commemorations and public
events. After taking poetry and memoir writing workshops through the Santa

### Kristine Leonard Young

![Kristine Leonard Young](/documents/Kristine-L.-Young.webp)

Kristine has been creating tiny books, writing and fine artwork
ever since she can remember. A Bahá’í pioneer all her life,
she has lived in six different countries on four different
continents and now lives in Alaska. She has written and
edited over the years – journals, newsletters, book reviews,
advertising, art books, photographs, and is currently co-editor
of the Bahá’í news for Alaska, Bahá’í Alaska.

‘Art and writing have always been intertwined for me
however, writing became a core part of my life beginning with
my first research questions written in 1981 to the International Bahá’í Centre about the life of my
great aunt Counsellor Leonora Holsapple Armstrong who passed away in Brazil in 1980. With
the arrival of my first package of photocopied Tablets and letters from Haifa, I was hooked. Little
did I know that it would be a life-long path!’

Over the years the research paper binders travelled with Kristine from Indiana to South Africa to
California, to Haifa and then to Alaska. Her research in addition to the five months spent living
with her great aunt in Brazil promise to become an inspiring life story of dedication and stalwart
perseverance.

Writing and art have always been connected in Kristine’s life and she has been an avid reader,
painter and ‘creative’ over her career including teaching art for ten years. Her recent great love
is plein air painting which she has great opportunities for in the wilds of Alaska.
