 ## There are so many ways to contribute to DRBI and we thank you!

 Dear Community, providing you the freedom to explore, learn, collaborate and inspire is – and will continue to be – at the heart of our mission.


<ImgBlock title="Our Amazon Wishlist" id="amazon"
  description="Help us gear up for a busy next season. We've got a dozen study retreats planned, but need help gearing up our dorms with pillows, sheets and blankets, shower curtains, a couple instant-pots, a reverse-osmosis filter and a few other items. You can help by purchasing an item form the list and have it shipped directly to us."

<ImgBlock title="Making the Desert Bloom" id="bloom"
  description="Help us green the entire campus: Brooke and Telahoun Molla are working tirelessly to plant hundreds of trees and and desert shrubs to give us shady areas to sit and study. Help fund hundreds of trees and dozens of concrete benches to make our campus a beautiful place to learn and grow."

<ImgBlock title="Firm Foundation Winter School" id="ffa"
  description="Desert Rose is the perfect winter retreat for study and reflection. Every year we host church groups for Bible studies -- and it would be a shame if we didn't have this for our own community. Where else can Baha'is go to study the Íqán, Gleanings, God Passes By and the Dawn-Breakers? Let's become better teachers together by teaching ourselves first. This is the “firm foundation” program."

<ImgBlock title="Help DRBI Grow!" id="growth"
  description="Desert Rose is presently 100% volunteer and we are struggling to be a model of self-sufficiency. Sometimes this means that our facilities are not as gold-plated as other heavily-subsidized schools. But that is OK with us! We want to be a model of adding value to the community rather than being a burden to the fund. Our revenue is derived from our hosting and accomodations, between our own programs. Help us grow those accomodations!"

<ImgBlock title="Seeking Work-Study Volunteers!" id="volunteer"

     We need your help to deliver a solid educational experience, particularly with kitchen and cleaning tasks. To ensure volunteers don't miss out on educational content, we've created a schedule allowing for both. Work-study volunteers can attend all programs and events, working in the kitchen in the mornings and during long breaks after each meal. If interested in work-study volunteering starting in October 2024, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@drbi.org" class="text-blue-500">info@drbi.org</a>.
