 ## There are so many ways to contribute to DRBI and we thank you!

 Dear Community, providing you the freedom to explore, learn, collaborate and inspire is – and will continue to be – at the heart of our mission.





<ImgBlock title="Our Amazon Wishlist" id="amazon"
  description="Help us gear up for a busy next season. We've got a dozen study retreats planned, but need help gearing up our dorms with pillows, sheets and blankets, shower curtains, a couple instant-pots, a reverse-osmosis filter and a few other items. You can help by purchasing an item form the list and have it shipped directly to us."

<ImgBlock title="Firm Foundation Winter School" id="ffa"
  description="Desert Rose is the perfect winter retreat for study and reflection. Every year we host church groups for Bible studies -- and it would be a shame if we didn't have this for our own community. Where else can Baha'is go to study the Íqán, Gleanings, God Passes By and the Dawn-Breakers? Let's become better teachers together by teaching ourselves first. This is the “firm foundation” program."

<ImgBlock title="Help DRBI Grow!" id="growth"
  description="Desert Rose is presently 100% volunteer and we are struggling to be a model of self-sufficiency. Sometimes this means that our facilities are not as gold-plated as other heavily-subsidized schools. But that is OK with us! We want to be a model of adding value to the community rather than being a burden to the fund. Our revenue is derived from our hosting and accomodations, between our own programs. Help us grow those accomodations!"

     We need your help to deliver a solid educational experience, particularly with kitchen and cleaning tasks. To ensure volunteers don't miss out on educational content, we've created a schedule allowing for both. Work-study volunteers can attend all programs and events, working in the kitchen in the mornings and during long breaks after each meal. If interested in work-study volunteering starting in October 2024, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@drbi.org" class="text-blue-500">info@drbi.org</a>.
