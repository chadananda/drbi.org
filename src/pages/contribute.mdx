 ## There are so many ways to contribute to DRBI and we thank you!

 Dear Community, providing you the freedom to explore, learn, collaborate and inspire is – and will continue to be – at the heart of our mission.

{/*  Start with Amazon Wishlist Instructions (amazonimg)

Instructions are like: "Help us gear up for a busy next season. We have a dozen study retreats planned, but need help gearing up our dorms with pillows, sheets and blankets -- for all 40 dormiotry beds. Plus shower curtains, a bread mixer, a couple large instant-pots for making lunch, a hotel-style waffle iron, a constant-flow reverse-osmosis filter, an ice machine and a few other items. We have an Amazon Wishlist with items that we need for our programs. You can purchase items from the list and have them shipped directly to us. Click the button below to view our wishlist."

{/*  Next, let's add our giveButter donation widget for the the Firm Foundation Program

 Help us create Baha'i education programs. Desert Rose is the perfect winter retreat for study and reflection. Every year we host church groups for Bible study retreats and it is an epic shame if we cannot do the same for our own community. Where else can Baha'is go to study the Íqán, Gleanings, God Passes By and the Dawn-Breakers? Let's become better teachers together by first teaching ourselves. This is our “firm foundation” program.

{/*  Next, let's add a general funds contribution section

 title: "Help DRBI Grow!"

Description: Desert Rose is presently 100% volunteer and we are struggling to be a model of self-sufficiency. Sometimes this means that our facilities are not as gold-plated as people are used to with heavily-subsidized schools run by the Baha'i adminstrative institutions. And that is OK with us! We want to be a model of adding value to the community rather than being a burden to the fund. Our revenue is derived from our hosting and accomodations, between our own programs. Help us grow!

{/*  Next, let's add a volunteers section

 title: "Seeking Work-Study Volunteers!"

Description: We really want to deliver a solid schedule of programs and events, but we need your help. We especially need help in the kitchen and cleaning. However, we don't want our volunteers to miss out on great educational content, so we've created a schedule that allows for both. Our work-study volunteers will be able to attend all of the programs and events that they want to, and will be able to work in the kitchen in the morning and during the long breaks after each meal.

If you would be interested in work-study volunteering beginning in October of 2024, please contact us at info@drbi.org.
