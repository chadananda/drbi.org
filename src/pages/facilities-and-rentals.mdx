## Desert Rose is a great Venue for Retreats and Events

Conveniently located between Tucson and Phoenix, Desert Rose is a great venue for retreats, workshops, and events. Our facilities include a large meeting hall, a commercial kitchen, a dormitory which sleeps 40, a boondocking RV park, a campground and a dozen apartments.

We use AirBnb to rent our facilities and apartments when not in use. This provides us with required insurance and a single calendar.


## For Retreats, rent our entire <b>Retreat Center</b>: (~ $900/night) <br/>__Includes [the main Hall](#ehh), [the Roundhouse](#rh), [the Dorms](#guf) and use of [the Pool](#pool)__

Groups wanting a retreat center can book this complete package. Note: we do not yet provide cooking and cleaning services during events. You will be responsible for running the kitchen or catering in meals.

<br/><br/>


## For Personal Accommodation, rent our <b>Casa Suites</b>: (~ $90/night)<br/>  __These are [individual apartments](#casas) rented separately__

Some participants will not want to sleep in a dormitory and they can book a private apartment individually. We have one and two-bedroom apartments. Note: these are on a first-come first-serve basis and they fill quickly, so tell participants to book well in advance.

<ImgBlock title="Our Dormitory" id="guf"
  description="Our dormitory bulding (Guffy Center) has two wings, each with 20-beds and an attached studio apartment. Each dormitory wing sleeps 20 and includes a commercial bathroom with showers. The dormitory is rustic, but comfortable."

<ImgBlock title="Take a Dip in our Pool" id="pool"
  description="Every oasis in the desert needs a watering hole. In our case we were required to have a large fire suppression reservoir onsite, so the creative architects decided to fulfill the requirement with a large beautiful swimming pool (connected, of course, to the fire suppression system). Our pool is wheelchair accessible and a fun additional activity for any event."

<ImgBlock title="RV Park" id="rv"
  description="Our new 5-acre RV Park is in the early stages, with only boondocking capabilities (which means parking, water and dump-station only). We hope to expand this in the future to provide a destination for snowbirding winter participants and volunteers."
