  Hinduism is one of the oldest religions in the world, known for its rich
  tapestry of philosophy, mythology, rituals, and spiritual practices. It is a
  complex, polytheistic religion with an emphasis on dharma (moral law), samsara
  (reincarnation), karma (action and subsequent reaction), and moksha
  (liberation from the cycle of life and death). Hinduism is deeply interwoven
  with the cultural and social fabric of the Indian subcontinent, offering a
  pluralistic approach to spirituality.
