  Shinto, also known as kami-no-michi, is the indigenous spirituality of Japan
  and involves the worship of kami, the gods or spirits. It focuses on ritual
  practices to be carried out diligently to establish a connection between
  present-day Japan and its ancient past. Shinto practices were first recorded
  and codified in the written historical records of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki
  in the 8th century. However, these practices have been woven into Japanese
  life long before that. Shinto has no absolute founder, no dogma, no foreign
  influence, and it has survived in various forms through the ages.
