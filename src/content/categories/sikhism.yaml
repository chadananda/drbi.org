  Sikhism is a monotheistic religion originating from the Punjab region of the
  Indian subcontinent in the 15th century, founded by Guru Nanak Dev Ji and
  subsequently led by a succession of nine other Gurus. It emphasizes
  egalitarianism, devotion to one God, the pursuit of justice, and adherence to
  a set of values codified in the Guru Granth Sahib, the central religious
  scripture of Sikhism. Its followers, known as Sikhs, are expected to embody
  the principles of selfless service, community, and moral integrity.
