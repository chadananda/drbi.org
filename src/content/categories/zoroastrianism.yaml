  Zoroastrianism is one of the world's oldest continuously practiced
  monotheistic religions, originating in ancient Persia. It centers around the
  teachings of the prophet Zoroaster (or Zarathustra) and revolves around the
  dualistic cosmology of good and evil, emphasizing the individual's
  responsibility to choose righteousness. It also includes a significant focus
  on the concepts of purity and ritual, life after death, and the eventual
  triumph of good.
