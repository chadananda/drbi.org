  Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of
  Jesus Christ as presented in the New Testament. It is the world's largest
  religion, with numerous denominations, practices, and theological
  perspectives, but unified by the belief in one God and the narrative of Jesus'
  life, death, and resurrection as the foundation for salvation and eternal
  life. Christian doctrine and worship are influenced by a rich historical
  tradition and an extensive body of scripture and ecclesiastical literature.
