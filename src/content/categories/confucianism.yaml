  Confucianism is an ancient Chinese ethical and philosophical system developed
  from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius. It emphasizes moral
  virtue, social harmony, and the importance of education, family, and
  respectful relationships in creating a just and orderly society. Though
  commonly referred to as a religion, it is more accurately a way of life and a
  guide to human morality and personal conduct.
