## Embark on a Transformative Journey: The Dawn-Breakers Challenge Returns on November 1, 2024!

We are thrilled to announce the return of the highly acclaimed "Dawn-Breakers Challenge" program, set to take place from November 1 to November 9, 2024, at the Desert Rose Baha''i Institute (DRBI) in Eloy, Arizona. This immersive 8-day retreat, facilitated by Chad Jones, offers a unique opportunity to delve deep into the pages of Nabil''s immortal history, _The Dawn-Breakers_, a book that the Guardian considered one of our greatest weapons in developing Baha''i identity and combating the false materialistic identities prevalent in today''s society.

<aside>
"Feel impelled appeal entire body American believers to henceforth regard Nabil''s soul-stirring Narrative as essential adjunct to reconstructed Teaching program, as unchallengeable textbook in their Summer Schools, as source of inspiration in all literary and artistic pursuits, and as unfailing instrument to allay distress and resist attacks of critical, disillusioned humanity." - Shoghi Effendi, June 1932
</aside>

## What to Expect

The "Dawn-Breakers Challenge" is an intensive program designed to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the book''s content. Through engaging discussions, character introductions, timeline reviews, and historical and geographical explanations, attendees will gain a profound appreciation for the sacrifices and heroism of the early believers.

<aside>
"The Guardian sincerely hopes and prays that the study of the Dawn-Breakers will inspire the friends to greater activity and more exerted energy in serving the Cause and spreading its message...The life of those heroes of the Faith should teach us what true sacrifice is, and to what extent we should forego our personal and worldly interests while endeavouring to carry the divine message to the four corners of the earth." - Shoghi Effendi, April 1933
</aside>

The Guardian emphasized that "every Baha''i should master these books and be able to explain their contents to others." Join us as we rise to this challenge and embark on a transformative journey of learning and spiritual growth.

"I would strongly urge you to utilize, to the utmost possible extent, the wealth of authentic material gathered in Nabíl''s stirring Narrative and to encourage the youth to master and to digest the facts recorded therein as a basis for their future work in the teaching field, and as a sustenance to their spiritual life and activities in the service of the Cause." - Shoghi Effendi, November 1932
</aside>

<aside>
"Shoghi Effendi found great pleasure and spiritual upliftment while working on the translation of Nabíl''s Narrative. The life of those who figure in it is so stirring that every one who reads those accounts is bound to be affected and impelled to follow their footsteps of sacrifice in the path of the Faith. The Guardian believes, therefore, that it should be studied by the friends, especially the youth who need some inspiration to carry them through these troubled days." - On behalf of Shoghi Effendi, March 1933
