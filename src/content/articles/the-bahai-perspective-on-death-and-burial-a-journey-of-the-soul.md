## The Baha''i Faith has specific guidelines and practices surrounding death and burial, which are rooted in its spiritual teachings and beliefs.

### Burial over Cremation

The Baha''i teachings call for burial rather than cremation. According to the Baha''i writings, the physical body should be treated with respect and allowed to decompose naturally after death. Cremation is discouraged, as it is seen as a violation of the natural process of decomposition. 


### The Bahá’í Obligatory Prayer for the Departed

The Baha''i Faith has a specific prayer that is recited for the deceased, known as the "Prayer for the Dead." This prayer is typically recited at the burial service and is intended to assist the soul in its journey towards the spiritual realms. The prayer begins:

> *O my God! This is Thy servant and the son of Thy servant who hath believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and set his face towards Thee, wholly detached from all except Thee. Thou art, verily, of those who show mercy the most merciful.*

> *Deal with him, O Thou Who forgivest the sins of men and concealest their faults, as beseemeth the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy grace. Grant him admission within the precincts of Thy transcendent mercy that was before the foundation of earth and heaven. There is no God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.*

### Burial Observance

The Baha''i observance for burial is simple and dignified. The body is wrapped in a shroud, typically made of silk or cotton, and placed in a coffin or casket. The coffin or casket is then lowered into the grave, and the Prayer for the Departed is recited. Baha''u''llah emphasizes the importance of detachment from the physical world:

> *"O Son of the Supreme! I have made death a messenger of joy to thee. Wherefore dost thou grieve? I made the light to shed on thee its splendor. Why dost thou veil thyself therefrom?"*

The Baha''i teachings encourage simplicity in burial practices and discourage excessive rituals or ceremonies. The focus is on the spiritual journey of the soul and the recognition of the transient nature of the physical world.
