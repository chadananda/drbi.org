##### LCPL US MARINE CORPS

>LOVING HUSBAND FATHER
POPPOP GREAT-GRANDFATHER

>ELOY — Glenn O’Neal, 77, died peacefully at home after a valiant fight with cancer and kidney failure on Aug. 13, 2019.

Mr. O’Neal was born in Cooper, Texas, on Dec. 8, 1941, to Rubye (Tevis) and Earl O’Neill. He was a Marine and a Vietnam War veteran. Alaska and airplanes were forever in his heart. He was an avid fisherman and hunter, an airplane mechanic and a heavy duty truck mechanic.

He also was an artist. He created many things from horseshoe art to beaded turtles. Turtles are part of his Choctaw heritage’s creation story. A man of many talents, he was most passionate about the teachings of the Baha’i Faith and the building of Desert Rose Baha’i Institute.

Survivors include his wife of 45 years, Mary; five daughters and sons, Shelly, Kara, Heather, Timothy and Dennis; six grandchildren; and a great-grandson.

He was proud to be called Poppop by his goddaughter Shoshannah and was in awe of all the new things she learned growing up and going through engineering school.

He was preceded in death by a son, Timothy; and two sisters: Anne and Sarah.

Graveside service at 9 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 17, at Desert Rose Memorial Garden, followed by, at his request, hamburgers, hot dogs and all the fixings.
