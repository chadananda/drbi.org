####  Memorial for Shirley Macias, January 13, 1929 - March 8, 2016

> DEVOTED HANDMAIDEN OF BAHÁ’U’LLÁH
HER GLORIOUS SERVICES IMPERISHABLE.

Born in Los Angeles and the daughter of Israel Feinberg and Ida Edleberg, Mrs. Macias was a graduate of Hollywood High School and embarked on a career as a dancer and actress under the stage name of Shirley Ross. Known as a “true citizen of the world,” she served the Baha’i Faith in Honduras, in Argentina, at the Baha’i National Center in Wilmette, Illinois, and at the Baha’i World Centre in Haifa, Israel. After retiring as a legal secretary in Los Angeles, she moved to Desert Rose Baha’i Institute in Eloy, where she served as an administrative assistant and taught Spanish classes.

She was the author of “Conqueror of Hearts: My Memories of Hand of the Cause of God A.Q. Faizi.” She also was the editor of “The Diary of Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání Chronicling ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Journey to America.”

She was preceded in death by her beloved husband, Ricardo. She is survived by a brother, Robert Gold of Escondido, California; two nieces; and four grand-nephews.

Burial will be at 2 p.m. Saturday in Desert Rose Memorial Garden, followed by a memorial service in the Round House at Desert Rose Baha’i Institute.
