  "fullDescription": "The Four Valleys: The Seeker’s Path to Spiritual Maturation\r\nFri Oct 31st 4:00pm - Sun Nov 2nd 4:00pm\r\n\r\nThis course will dive deeply into the spiritual theme of the Seeker’s Path – the powerful journey of search, discovery, growth, and human maturation in Baha'u'llah's mystical writings which every soul is called upon to undertake. The Four Valleys uses a stage-specific ladder to describe the process of spiritual growth, awareness, and maturation – the journey of the soul:\r\n\r\nBriefly; the journey of the soul is necessary. The pathway of life is the road which leads to divine knowledge and attainment. Without training and guidance the soul could never progress beyond the conditions of its lower nature ... - Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 295-296.\r\n\r\nEvery religion has these ladders of development. Contemporary psychology contains them, too, especially in the works of Carl Jung. In his book Modern Man in Search of the Soul, Jung described four specific steps of psychological growth, and called that journey “the mystical heart of all religions.” During this weekend, participants will learn about and practice the four steps that Baha'u'llah, the prophet founder of the Bahá’í Faith, describes.\r\n\r\nDavid Langness is a writer, editor, and sailor on the sea of joy. For the past 14 years, he served as the editor of BahaiTeachings.org, and is now an editor at George Ronald Publishers in England. He has been a Bahá’í for 57 years, and his book The Seeker’s Path: Myth, Maturity, and the Bahá’í Teachings, will soon be published. His course at DRBI will be based on that upcoming book.\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nFriday\r\n- 4:00-6:00 PM - Registration\r\n\r\n- 6:00-7:00 PM - Dinner\r\n\r\n- 7:00-8:00 PM - Orientation and Introduction\r\n\r\nSaturday\r\n- 8:00 - 9:00 AM - Breakfast\r\n\r\n- 9:00 - 12:30 PM - Sessions\r\n\r\n- 12:30 - 2:00 PM - Lunch\r\n\r\n- 2:00 - 6:00 PM - Sessions\r\n\r\n- 6:00 - 7:00 PM - Dinner\r\n\r\n- 7:00 - 8:00 PM - Music/Arts\r\n\r\nSunday\r\n- 8:00 - 9:00 AM - Breakfast\r\n\r\n- 9:00 - 12:30 AM - Sessions\r\n\r\n- 12:30 - 2:00 PM - Lunch\r\n\r\n- 2:00 - 4:00 PM - Final session & farewell\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Desert Rose Winter and Spring Programs:\r\nOur winter and spring retreats at Desert Rose focus on the in-depth study of core spiritual literature and historical texts.
