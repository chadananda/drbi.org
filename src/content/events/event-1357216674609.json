Through this guided approach, participants will develop:\r\nIncreased confidence as a citizen in an emerging global order;Capacity to apply divine teachings in contemporary contexts; andMeaningful connections with others on the same spiritual journey.\r\nJoin us in examining this transformative work that continues to guide and inspire Bahá'í communities worldwide.\r\n\r\nDaniel B.

He holds master’s degrees in education and clinical psychology and a Ph.D. in educational psychology. He has also studied law and will retire soon as a senior attorney.
