  "fullDescription": "Preparing for Christ’s New Name\nFri Nov 14th 4:00pm - Sun 16th 4:00pm\n\nHow much do you know about The Bible and promises related to Christ’s return? In this course, you will explore a variety of spiritual themes on Divine Revelation and learn about the insights the Bahá’í Writings offer on: Salvation and the Station of God’s Manifestation; the End Times; the Nature of Miracles; Christ’s Resurrection; and the Spirit of Truth. Participants will better understand their role as a teacher/learner of Biblical concepts and examine effective ways to share these concepts with others.\n\nThe weekend will be spent in transformative dialogue and interactive activities to explore spiritual themes regarding God, His Manifestations, and His Word. The presenters have been giving this course in California to rave reviews. One recent participant, from a Christian background, said the course offered a \"really ‘safe place’ to learn and be heard.” The Bahá’í Writings affirm that “to be a Christian is to embody every excellence.\"\n\nAlex Gottdank credits the Hebrew Scriptures and Gospels for instilling in him a thirst for spiritual understanding and a love for God and His messengers; he has many stories to share about teaching history in Micronesia for 13 years. Scott Patton holds weekly Bible studies classes and seeks to synthesize Biblical passages with the Bahá’í writings to derive a greater understanding of God’s will for humanity. He was a high school English and Business teacher for over 30 years.\n\nEvent Schedule:\n\nFriday\n- 4:00-6:00 PM - Registration\n\n- 6:00-7:00 PM - Dinner\n\n- 7:00-8:00 PM - Orientation and Introduction\n\nSaturday\n- 8:00 - 9:00 AM - Breakfast\n\n- 9:00 - 12:30 PM - Sessions\n\n- 12:30 - 2:00 PM - Lunch\n\n- 2:00 - 6:00 PM - Sessions\n\n- 6:00 - 7:00 PM - Dinner\n\n- 7:00 - 8:00 PM - Music/Arts\n\nSunday\n- 8:00 - 9:00 AM - Breakfast\n\n- 9:00 - 12:30 AM - Sessions\n\n- 12:30 - 2:00 PM - Lunch\n\n- 2:00 - 4:00 PM - Final session & farewell\n\nIntroduction to Desert Rose Winter and Spring Programs:\nOur winter and spring retreats at Desert Rose focus on the in-depth study of core spiritual literature and historical texts. Set in the serene desert environment of Arizona, we enjoy a perfect winter retreat environment. These programs provide ain ideal opportunity for reflection, learning, and community engagement.\n\nFees, Prerequisites, and Materials:\nAttendees are required to register in advance, with fees covering all sessions, meals, and materials. Specific prerequisites for participation and a list of materials to be studied will be provided upon registration.\n\nRegistration:\nRegistration includes 6 meals, materials and accommodations in our dormitory.
