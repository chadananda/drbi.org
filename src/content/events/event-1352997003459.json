Classes specifically designed for both adults and youth make this a perfect retreat for the whole family.\r\n\r\nThe Kitáb-i-Íqán (Book of Certitude) is a pivotal Bahá’í text that illuminates the hidden connections between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, unravels prophetic mysteries, and offers a profound perspective on religious continuity. This program will guide participants through the full text of this enlightening book and include in-depth discussions on its core themes.\r\n\r\nThrough comprehensive study, you'll:\r\nExplore the origins of Bahá’í revelation;Witness how ancient prophecies from the Bible and Qur'án have been fulfilled in unexpected ways;Grasp the profound concept of progressive revelation that unites all divine faiths; andMaster the symbolic language that enriches our understanding of religious scriptures.\r\nGhaneh Fananapazir is a physician and professor of radiology at the University of California Davis. He grew up in Scotland, North Carolina, and the Washington DC area. He went to Vanderbilt University for his undergraduate degree and then spent three years serving at the Bahá’í World Centre, in Haifa, Israel. He attended medical school at the University of Maryland and then completed his training at Georgetown University and Duke University. He has an interest in interreligious dialogue, particularly involving Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. He and his wife Melody have two children.\r\n\r\nConcurrent with Dr. Fananapazir's session, children (ages 8+) and youth will study the Writings using the performing arts and will perform a play at the end of the weekend.
