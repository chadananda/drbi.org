He is a versatile and original composer and performer, blending genres, instruments, and cultures into a unique sound. His biggest delight comes when uniting people through music. See: https://aliyoussefi.comAs a Bahá'í, Ali has, from a young age, drawn inspiration from the sacred and mystical writings of his faith that reflect on the purpose of our creation, the underlying unity of all religions, the oneness of humanity, and the effort needed to transform the reality we live in.
