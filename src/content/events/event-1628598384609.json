This course considers a profound and often overlooked concept in the Bahá’í Writings known as “The Primal Will.”\r\n\r\nFar from being an abstract concept, it is the cause of existence and the “inner reality of all things.” It relates to the laws of nature; the attraction and repulsion of atoms; and to the unfolding of life itself.\r\n\r\nIt is a concept that has appeared in ancient Greek philosophy, medieval Christian theology, and modern cosmology – and that bridges ancient and modern, sacred and secular, consciousness and unconscious matter. In this course, we will learn about:\r\n\r\n   * what the “Primal Will” is;\r\n\r\n   * ways it appears in the Bahá’í writings;\r\n\r\n   * its fascinating history;\r\n\r\n   * how it relates to both the Creative Word of God and the Manifestations of God;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n   * how this concept can help us make sense of our place in the universe.\r\n\r\nSteven received dual bachelors’ degrees in physics and philosophy from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University, where he studied under the Nobel-prize-winning cosmologist Jim Peebles.  He subsequently volunteered for 13 years at the Bahá’í World Center in Haifa, Israel in its Research Department, where he coordinated the indexing and collation of the Bahá’í Sacred Writings and their translation from Persian and Arabic into English.  During that period, he concurrently held an academic appointment in the Physics Department at the Technion University in Haifa and published original research on the masses of nearby galaxies.  He currently resides in Portland, Oregon with his wife and three daughters.\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nFriday\r\n- 4:00-6:00 PM - Registration\r\n\r\n- 6:00-7:00 PM - Dinner\r\n\r\n- 7:00-8:00 PM - Orientation and Introduction\r\nSaturday\r\n- 8:00 - 9:00 AM - Breakfast\r\n\r\n- 9:00 - 12:30 PM - Sessions\r\n\r\n- 12:30 - 2:00 PM - Lunch\r\n\r\n- 2:00 - 6:00 PM - Sessions\r\n\r\n- 6:00 - 7:00 PM - Dinner\r\n\r\n- 7:00 - 8:00 PM - Music/Arts\r\nSunday\r\n- 8:00 - 9:00 AM - Breakfast\r\n\r\n- 9:00 - 12:30 AM - Sessions\r\n\r\n- 12:30 - 2:00 PM - Lunch\r\n\r\n- 2:00 - 4:00 PM - Final session & farewell\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Desert Rose Winter and Spring Programs:\r\nOur winter and spring retreats at Desert Rose focus on the in-depth study of core spiritual literature and historical texts.
